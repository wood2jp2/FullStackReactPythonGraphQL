Lecture 13 - Creating Base Django Project
    - We're going to use graphene-django to build out the back end on the course project (react-tracks) here.
        + Going to use a GraphQL IDE.
    
    1. Create directory, navigate to, and start virtual environment within.
        + pipenv shell
            > Creates Pipfile to track our packages.
    2. Install django, graphene-django, django-graphql-jwt, django-cors-headers
    3. pipenv install --dev autopep8
        + This is an code formatter installed as a dev package.
    4. Then we need to initialize our django project with 'django-admin startproject app'
    5. Next we need to create a database with base database tables in it.
        + Change directory into app.
        + We need to migrate the tables with 'python manage.py migrate' which generates the db.sqlite3 file.
    6. Last we can start the project with 'python manage.py runserver' to prove that it works.

Lecture 14: Making Tracks App / Modeling Track Data
    - Remember, Django separates projects into 'apps' which helps with separation of concerns.
        + We are going to have an app per type of data, one for track and one for user.
        + initialize an app with 'python manage.py startapp tracks'
    - We need to now model our tracks.
        + Django is going to take this and create a database table for us.
        + Supply fields as well as their types from the models object
    - Once the new model is complete, we need to activate it.
        + Go to the sub app folder in settings.py, and add the app name (tracks) to the list of Apps.
        + Two Steps: 
            1. Create migration file with the makemigrations command, which will generate the sql commands that allows us to interact with our DB based off what was defined.
                > python manage.py makemigrations
            2. After you run makemigrations, make sure that you migrate the app that you just made a migration within.
                > 'python manage.py migrate'
